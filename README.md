# Project1

## String generation

String candidate in this program is generated by number. Number is first turned into a 96-based number. Each digit of tranformed number will be add 32 and transform into corresponding ascii character and then form a string. All characters in this string can be directly printed. Number starts from 1 and increment itself by 1 everytime.

## work unit

I increase work unit from 1 to 33. And every time I increased it by 2
For every work unit, I measure how many average bitcoins the program can find in 10 seconds.
```
The table below is the result
workunit   average bitcoins per 10 seconds
1          16.7
3          41.0
5          56.0
7          66.7
9          75.7
11         80.0
13         79.0
15         83.3
17         84.0
19         85.0
21         85.7
23         86.3
25         86.0
27         86.0
29         87.0
31         85.7
33         86.7
```
From table we can see amount of average bitcoins increases dramatically at first and then become stable. And I think keep increasing work unit will not significantly reduce this amount because most calculation will be used on bitcoin calculation rather than on the call of worker. Thus I choose 200 to ensure program have good performance on most machines.

## Result

Result of ./program1 4 is in result.txt

## The largest number of working machines

This program were able to run on 3 machines. I haven't tried it on more computers.
